# Customer Churn Analysis Project

This repository contains the results of a customer churn analysis simulation completed as part of BCG's Data Science program on Forage. The project demonstrates advanced data analytics skills, efficient data analysis, and model optimization techniques.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze customer churn for XYZ Analytics. The simulation included the following key components:

1. **Customer Churn Analysis Simulation**:
   - Demonstrated advanced data analytics skills.
   - Identified essential client data and outlined a strategic investigation approach.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Conducted efficient data analysis using Python.
   - Utilized Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
   - Employed data visualization techniques to interpret trends.

3. **Model Optimization**:
   - Engineered and optimized a Random Forest model.
   - Achieved an accuracy rate of 85% in predicting customer churn.

4. **Executive Summary**:
   - Delivered a concise executive summary for the Associate Director.
   - Provided actionable insights for informed decision-making based on the analysis.

## Files Included

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and visualization code.
- `model_optimization.py`: Python script for engineering and optimizing the Random Forest model.
- `executive_summary.pdf`: PDF document with the executive summary and actionable insights.

## Installation and Setup

To run the analysis and model optimization locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repository
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed, and then install the necessary packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
4. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open data_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to explore the data analysis and visualization.
   - Run model_optimization.py to execute the model training and evaluation.

## Usage
   - Review the data_analysis.ipynb notebook to understand the data exploration and visualization techniques used.
   - Check the model_optimization.py script for details on model training and performance metrics.
   - Consult the executive_summary.pdf for a summary of findings and recommendations.
